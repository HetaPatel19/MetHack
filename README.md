# metHacks
project for hackathon.
Inspiration: 
We created Ecosort because we believe that everyone has a role to play in protecting our planet. As environmental challenges continue to mount, it's more important than ever to empower individuals with the knowledge and tools they need to make a positive impact. Ecosort is a fun and engaging way to inspire environmental awareness and action, reaching people of all ages and backgrounds. By gamifying sustainability, we hope to make eco-friendly habits more accessible and appealing, encouraging players to adopt these practices in their daily lives

What it does: 
Ecosort is an environmental game that challenges players to make a positive impact on the planet. The game's primary goal is to inspire players to adopt eco-friendly habits and become stewards of the environment. Ecosort achieves this by presenting an interactive challenge related to recycling waste items in the appropriate bins. Players are rewarded for their progress, and their actions have a direct impact on the virtual world within the game

How we built it: 
Ecosort was built using the Pygame library, a powerful tool for creating 2D games in Python. Pygame provides a user-friendly framework for game development, with a wide range of built-in features and functions that make it easy to build interactive games like Ecosort. With Pygame, we were able to design a visually appealing game environment, complete with engaging characters and fun animations

Challenges we ran into:
The process of building the game was challenging, but it was also a rewarding learning experience that allowed us to push our skills to the next level. Pygame is a complex library, and it required us to learn a variety of programming concepts and techniques, including object-oriented programming, and event handling.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We're incredibly proud of our team for learning how to use Pygame and using it to create a fully functional game like Ecosort.

What we learned:
Building Ecosort with Pygame was not only a fun and creative process, but it was also a valuable learning experience. As a team, we had to learn a new programming language and become proficient in using the Pygame library. We faced many challenges along the way, from figuring out how to program player controls to implementing complex scoring systems. We had to debug our code multiple times, and we learned how to troubleshoot and fix issues quickly and efficiently

What's next for ECOSORT:
While Ecosort is already an engaging and interactive game, we believe there is still much more potential to explore. Our next step is to make the game accessible online, develop a mobile app, and make it into a VR game as well. We believe that these advancements will help us continue to promote environmental awareness and inspire individuals to take positive action for the planet.
